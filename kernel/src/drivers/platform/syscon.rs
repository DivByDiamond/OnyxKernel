//! SiFive test finisher — poweroff, reboot, and exit codes.
//!
//! QEMU virt exposes a "test device" at 0x100000 that accepts a 32-bit
//! command: bits[15:0] = exit code, bits[31:16] = action. Writing a
//! FINISHER_PASS / FINISHER_FAIL code cleanly ends the QEMU session.
//! On real SiFive boards the same register fronts the test chip's reset
//! controller, so we keep the writes harmless when running on hardware.
