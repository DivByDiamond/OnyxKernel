//! Power management — idle/sleep states + WFI dispatcher.
//!
//! Provides a thin abstraction over RISC-V S-mode power management:
//!   - `idle()` issues WFI until the next interrupt.
//!   - `sleep()` disables the timer and enters a long WFI loop.
//!   - `wake()` re-arms the timer tick.
//!
//! Full DVFS / domain power-down is delegated to `cpufreq` and to the
//! board's PMIC (not yet modelled here).
